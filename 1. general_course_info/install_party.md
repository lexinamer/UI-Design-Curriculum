# Install Party
Welcome to The Iron Yard!


# Open a Github Account
If you haven't done so already, go to [Github](https://github.com/) and open a new account.


# Adobe
Sign up for [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://creative.adobe.com/plans?promoid=NV3KR7S1&mv=other) (if you don't already have Adobe CS4 or higher). We will primarily be using Photoshop and Illustrator in this course. You can use everything free for the first 30 days but the will have to pay for at least the 12 weeks of class. There are two options we recommend:

**Option 1** The CC annual account, paid monthly: $49.99 for all of the programs if the you agree to one year contract Total student cost for 4 months = $200 plus tax (plus remaining 8 months = $600 plus tax)

**Option 2** The CC monthly account month-to-month pricing: $74.99 for all of the programs (without cancellation fees) Total student cost for 4 months = $300 plus tax 


# Web Browser
Download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and set it as your default browser for the remainder of the course. It has a really great set of developer tools, plugins and extensions that makes it excellent for us to use as developers. 


# Communication Tool
Download [Slack for Desktop](https://slack.com/downloads/osx) as it will be our primary communication tool. Once you have downloaded it, right click on the icon in your mac menu bar, click options, and select `keep in dock`.


# Text Editor
Download [Atom](https://atom.io/) as it will be the code editor we use for the class. Atom is free, open source, very popular, and easy to use. 

Once it is downloaded, open the program and do the following:
1. Click on the `Atom` button in the navbar next to the apple icons
2. Go to `preferences`
3. Select `install` next to the + icon
4. Toggle the `themes` button and search for `outlander`
5. Install both the `Outlander UI` and `Outlander Syntax` packages
6. Select `themes` next to the paintbucket icon
7. Make sure the have the Outlander theme selected in both places (it should be come dark with different colors)

# Command Line Manager
Download [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/), which we will be using instead of Mac's default Terminal program. 

Once it is downloaded, open the program and do the follow:
1. Copy and paste the following: `xcode-select --install`
2. Hit enter and it should automatically download a bunch of packages
3. Copy and paste the following: `git --version` and hit enter
4. You should now see the following message: _git version 2.7.4 (Apple Git-66)_


# Zsh and Brew
The terminal uses shells to run things. The default shell is Bash, or Bourne-Again SHell. Zsh is an extended one that helps you save time, energy, and helps things run more smoothly.

You download [zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) through iTerm. Install the shell by copying and pasting the following and hitting enter: 
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Now copy and paste the following to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which is a packaging manager for the terminal that makes things easier to install. It will ask for your computer password- when you type it, nothing will appear for security reasons but when you are finished, just click enter:
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Now install a package called tree (which will help you in your first assignment Monday) by copying and pasting `brew install tree` and hitting enter. 


# WooHoo
You are ready to start class! Get some rest over the week, finish up any prework, and come ready to jump headfirst on Monday. Its going to be a great ride.

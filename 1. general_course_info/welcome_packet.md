## How We'll Communicate
*We provide a variety of communication methods, so help's never far away:*

#### Slack
Slack is a chat client with private and public channels, all internal to The Iron Yard Academy. We’ll use it to discuss questions, projects, amazing GIFs we find on the internet, and more. Check out the alumni rooms to connect with other grads.

#### Email
You’re always welcomed to email me, but Slack is your best bet for a semi-immediate response.

#### Phone
You’re welcomed to call me, especially if there’s an emergency. We’re here for you. Just keep in mind that we have families at home :)


## Career Support
The Campus Director and Ops team will talk to you about career support toward the middle of the course, but here are a few things to keep in mind:

#### Think about the types of jobs you’re interested in
We encourage students to start thinking about the types of industries and jobs you’d be interested in to use your programming skills. If you can continually focus on what you want to do after the program, it will make your search that much easier when you graduate and guide your community involvement throughout the course.

#### Develop your online presence
Please keep up with your online networks of choice - whether it be your blog, Twitter, or other network. Your presence online paired with your portfolio will be an incredible asset to your job search and identity as a developer beyond The Iron Yard.

#### Document Consistently
We require all grads in Career Support to create a portfolio website, where you will showcase 3-4 of your best projects at the end of the cohort. Make sure you maintain detailed readme files and polish your work throughout the course when possible to prepare.

#### Hungry for more?
Just ask. We're here to help.

## Do _something_

I can not emphasize enough that you can't learn to program by reading about programming. You learn to program by writing code and seeing if it works. If it doesn't you try to figure out why.

You will never _ever_ write perfect code. There is no such thing. So, don't bother trying to figure out the best way to do something, just do something. 

The students I've seen have the most trouble are those who spent hours searching the internet rather than trying to write code. This searching and reading suggests that they don't even understand the problem. 

## Mindset

It's useful to acknowledge that learning to program is very hard. Some students will pickup new concepts very quickly, while others may struggle. But, students come to this class from vastly different backgrounds. Don't compare yourself to other students, compare yourself to yourself. Where were you yesterday? What do you know now that you didn't a week ago? 

Come to class in a mindset to learn and grow. Intentionally decide to be engaged. Don't say "I'm not good at math." Instead say, "I'm getting better at math."

Try to determine how you learn best. Do you learn by hearing? Do you learn by seeing? Do you learn by reading? Do you learn by doing? Perhaps a combination of these? Find your strengths and exploit them.

* Demand what you need. Interrupt me.
* Intentionally decide to be engaged.
* Don't be afraid to ask questions.

## Intentional Practice

1. Practice with the intent of getting much better. This is what is called Deliberate Practice. Research has shown that practice with a goal of getting better leads to better learning.
2. Stay in the moment. When you focus and stay in the moment your neural networks form more than when you simply go through the motions.
3. Get as much feedback as possible. Don't avoid criticism and feedback. Seek it out. All great performers require great coaching.
4. Continually think about your situation. Understanding what you are trying to do will help keep you growing.
5. Do steps 1-4 regularly, not just sometimes. An ongoing focus on excellence breeds excellence.

## Self Improvement

There were a series of excellent podcasts by Freakonomics on the topic of self improvement. I strongly suggest you take time to give them a listen.

## Dirty Words

A personal pet peeve of mine are so-called dirty words. We all know the traditional four-letter words. We know we should avoid them in polite company. But, in general, they don't actually convey meaning when used. They're more of a tool to add emphasis to thoughts and feelings. They have power because we choose to give them power.

However, it's my own opinion that there is a different set dirty words that are much more nefarious. They have the power to worm their way into our subconscious and effect how we feel about ourselves and interact with the world.

These words are:

* Dumb
* Stupid
* Hate
* ...

We all have stories we tell ourselves. These stories influence how we treat ourselves and how we interact with the world. If you call yourself dumb every time you make a mistake, then clearly you think of yourself as dumb. That label influences what you think you are capable of. What you think you are capable of influences what you actually do.

Hate is also a very strong word. It's inflexible. If you tell yourself you hate math, then math becomes a torture to be suffered, not an opportunity to learn. If you hate a person, you shut yourself off to them, losing the opportunity to learn any lessons they may have to offer. 

Keep in mind that failure is primary way we learn. In general, we figure out what works by observing what _doesn't_ work. This is the foundation of science. If you call yourself dumb every time something doesn't work, or decide to hate a topic because it's difficult, you make it so much more difficult to learn. 

So, in this class let's try to avoid using the truly dirty words. And let's not worry too much of a traditional four letter words slips out from time to time.

## Ask Questions

Please, please, please interrupt lectures to ask questions. There's nothing worse as a lecturer than a silent class. By asking questions or volunteering commentary you create a positive feedback loop. It helps focus instruction where you need it. And, chances are, if you have a question others in the class do too.

### Ask Good Questions

There are no dumb questions. But, there are _good_ questions. [Read about how to ask good questions.](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

If you aren't asking questions, you either aren't involved, paying attention, or you aren't understanding enough to ask a question. Asking questions is a muscle, and you need to exercise that muscle!

### Ask Dumb Questions

Don't be afraid to make a fool of yourself.

Assume everyone here has the same question as you, but is too afraid to ask it. By asking your question, you help yourself _and_ everyone else, including me.

## Taking Notes

Taking notes in class won't help you if you take down the wrong notes.

I suggest that after every lecture, meeting, or any significant experience, you take a short moment to write down the most important points. Much of what you might want to make notes of are available in Tiyo already.

The hardest part of learning to code is not writing notes, but using and mastering the combinations of code you cover in class.

## The Zone

Have you ever become so involved in some task that you lost track of time? Do you ever find that there are points when you are doing something - musicians will probably relate to this - where everything just comes together and seems to work perfectly? This is call [The Zone, or Flow.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))

When you are in The Zone is when you are the most productive, learn the fastest, and do your best work.

It can be difficult to get into the zone, and, once in the zone, it is very easy to fall out of the zone. It might take you 20 minutes to really enter the zone, but a single notification from your phone can knock you out of the zone. At this point you're looking at another 20 minutes to get back into the zone.

To get into the zone:

 * Find a quiet space
 * Remove distractions
 * Shut the door
 * Shut off notifications
 * Silence your phone
 * Close web pages
 * Shut off the TV
 * Focus on what you're doing

If you see someone you think is in the zone, please think twice about interrupting them.

## Important Stuff First

Don't let yourself get stuck on unimportant details. An application will work without a beautiful icon, but it won't work without functioning code.

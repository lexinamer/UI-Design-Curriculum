# Campus Expectations and Remediation

There are some important details you need to be aware of and understand.

## Attendance

You are expected to attend:

* All lectures, including guest lectures
* Lab time
* Huddles

Four absences will lead to a remediation meeting with the campus ops team and your instructor.

If you are more than 30 minutes late to a class we considered an absence.

Our daily standup meeting starts at 9am. You must be in class and situated beforehand. If you arrive late for standup it counts as a tardy.

Two tardies counts as an absence. In other words, being late eight times will lead to a remediation meeting.

You must stay for lab time. Lab time is from 12 to 5pm. Leaving early counts as a tardy.

## Course Work

The Iron Yard requires 80% completion of _all_ assignments to graduate. This means you must submit all assignments. This includes your final projects. For many assignments, what constitutes 80% is subjective and will be determined by your instructor on a case-by-case basis. 

If you haven't reached 80% by Pitch Day, you will be putting your final project and ability to present in jeopardy.

If you don’t complete a final project by Presentation Day, you won’t graduate.

## Grading

Assignments are graded as follows:

* **Exceeds Expectations** - 100%. The assignment is excellent or goes above and beyond expectations.
* **Satisfactory** - 80% or more. The assignment is correct or acceptable. Most of the important parts of the project are complete and working.
* **Unsatisfactory** - Less than 80%. Effort was made, but important parts of the assignment are missing, incomplete, or don't work.
* **Incomplete** - The assignment was turned in but was not acceptable or functional.

## Remediation 

We want all of our students our students to be successful in this program. Unfortunately, sometimes students fall behind or experience other challenges. In these cases the Raleigh campus has a remediation process we follow to help students get back on track.

The remediation process is used under these circumstances:

* One un-submitted assignment by its due date.
* Three incomplete assignments.
* One instance of cheating or plagiarism.

When remediation begins, there will be an in-person meeting with the instructor and campus director. In this meeting we will collectively create an acton plan to get the student back on track. After one week there will be a followup meeting to evaluate the student's progress and prospects in the class.

## Explorer Mode

Look at other apps on the internet and find 3 to use as inspiration for your site.  I don't want you to copy a website exactly. I want you to find websites that you think have typographic, layout, or color aspects for example that you think could work well for the content and message of your site.

On paper, sketch out 1-2 full versions of your app. The app should include at least 6 screens but may need to include more.

Pay attention to user interaction and flow. Figure out this out during this phase and you will save yourself a lot of time once you start designing. Save the sketches in your coffeeapp Github repo in a folder called `sketches`

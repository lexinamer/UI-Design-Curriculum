# CRAP Design
C.R.A.P stands for contrast, repetition, alignment and proximity which are the four principles of design that web design should adhere to. http://www.dailyblogtips.com/crapthe-four-principles-of-sound-design/

### CRAP Principles
- Contrast: The idea behind contrast is to avoid elements on the page that are merely similar.
- Repetition: Repeat visual elements of the design throughout the piece
- Alignment: Every element should have some visual connection with another element on the page. 
- Proximity: Items relating to each other should be grouped close together.

# Gestalt Theory 
The Gestalt findings are most famously seen in the optical illusions we know from childhood, but the implications of this science are much farther reaching. 

While there is no one definitive list of all Gestalt principles, in 1954, Rudolf Arnheim compiled the most important ones in the book Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye. Here are the 5 main ones for visual design.

### Gestalt Principles
- Similarity: Users perceive objects that look similar as having similar uses. 
- Grouping: Following the same reasoning as similarity, grouping has the same effect with objects grouped together, even if they look different.  
- Closure: Users “complete” objects in their heads if they are partially obscured.
- Continuation: A user’s eye creates a kind of momentum as it moves from object to object, and lines increase this effect. 
- Figure and Ground: Your users instinctively differentiate between objects in the foreground (figures) and those in the background (ground).

# The 10 Elements of Design
- Line: The first and most basic element of design is that of the line. In graphic or web design, it’s any two connected points. Lines are useful for dividing space and drawing the eye to a specific location. 
- Color: It can stand alone, as a background, or be applied to other elements, like lines, shapes, textures or typography. Color creates a mood within the piece and tells a story about the brand. 
- Shape: Shapes, geometric or organic, add interest. Shapes are defined by boundaries, and everything is ultimately a shape. You must always think in terms of how the various elements of your design are creating shapes, and how those shapes are interacting.
- Space: Negative space is one of the most commonly underutilized and misunderstood aspects of designing for the page. The parts of the site that are left blank, whether that’s white or some other color, help to create an overall image. 
- Texture: Websites and graphic design do rely on the look and impression of texture on the screen, however. Textures can create a more three-dimensional appearance on this two-dimensional surface. It also helps build an immersive world.
- Text: Perhaps the single most important part of web design is typography. Like color, texture, and shapes, the fonts you use tell readers your style and branding and evoke a mood or feeling.
- Size: Playing with the scale and size of your objects, shapes, type and other elements add interest and emphasis. How boring would a symmetrical website with all similarly sized ingredients be? Very. However, make sure to keep like items alike. 
- Emphasis: While you can talk about emphasizing one thing or another, the element of emphasis has more to do with an object, color or style dominating another for a heightened sense of contrast. Contrast is intriguing, and it creates a focal point. 
- Balance: There are two schools of balance: symmetry and asymmetry. While most designers, artists and creative folks much prefer asymmetry for its eye-catching nature, symmetry does have its place. Websites are often one of them. 
- Harmony: Harmony is what you get when all the pieces work together. Nothing should be superfluous. Great design is just enough and never too much. Make sure all the details accord with one another before you consider the project complete.

  Learn the basic design concepts and terminology that we will use to design successful UI

User Interface (UI) Design focuses on anticipating what users might need to do and ensuring that the interface has elements that are easy to access, understand, and use to facilitate those actions.


# Design Concepts 

### Call to Action
A call to action (CTA) is an instruction to the audience to provoke an immediate response, usually using an imperative verb such as "call now", "find out more" or "visit a store today". In Ui design, this is often large and bold and obvious.

### Design for Scent
Users coming to your site all have one thing in common: their animal instinct. When a user wants to find content, they are on the hunt. Just like a fox in a forest, theyâ€™ll be most successful when they pick up a strong scent. As designers, we can help them on this hunt by creating easy to use websites.

### The Acronyms
UI Design is **FULL** of acronyms. Here are just a few that you might here over this course and in your careers. 
- UI: User Interface (UID for User Interface Design)
- UX: User Experience (UXD for User Experience Design)
- UCD: User Centered Design (users first)
- HCD: Human Centered Design (similar)

### Content First Design
This is a shift where designers and developers focus first on the content (conversation design) instead of the structure first (systems design).

### Mobile First Design 
Design for smaller screens first, then add more features and content for bigger and bigger screens. This design approach is also known as "progressive enhancement."

### Information Architecture: 
This is the creation of a structure and content for a website, application, or other project, that allows us to understand where we are as users, and where the information we want is in relation to our position. In UI/UX, we often rely on content inventories and sitemaps

### Design Sprints
The sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. Developed by Google Ventures (GV)

# UI Concepts 

### Affordances
Affordances are clues about how an object should be used, typically provided by the object itself or its context. For example, a link may be underlined.

### Design Patterns 
User Interface Design patterns are recurring solutions that solve common design problems. Design patterns are standard reference points for the experienced user interface designer. For example, saying things like hero and carousel navigation tabs.

### Common Site Features
There are common things that are probably included on every site, and vary depending on the type of site you need. Standard across all are header, footer, navbar, searchbar, etc.

### Copywriting
Tech companies often lack the writing staff to get copy written for every single interface, ad, and interaction which means that designers end up speaking directly to customers. When you have no copy, Lorem Ipsum is the standard filler text.

# Icon Design
Icons that are well designed exhibit a methodical and deliberate approach to the three major attributes that make up any icon design: form, aesthetic unity and recognition. They come in sets called icon sets that are groups of similar icons. Finding the right set for your project is crucial.

  What is design research, why is it important, and how do we do it?
---
# What is design research?
Design research is about understanding real people in the context of their everyday lives and then using what we learn to inspire our work. 

# Why design research?
- Seeking out data and information to inform design decisions
- Erika Hall's Just Enough Research reasons for design research
    * solves a design problem (that the client may or may not be aware of )
    * Discover cultural, social, or economical factors that may not have been previously obvious
    * competitive edge
    * setting valid goals for the forseeable future
    * figure out the company and the user's core purposes (may be different)
    * use research to narrow down options
    * add value to the design

# Benefits of Design Research 
- defend decisions
- get designers, developers, and clients on the same page (kickoff meeting)
- design based on fact rather than assumption 
- design based on the needs of the user (no more I likes!)
- sets us up with a strategy rather than a blank page

# What happens without research?
- risk factors go up
- going off brand
- possibility of insulting the audience
- harming user experience
- mismatched trends applied to product design
- heavy reliance on design trends that aren't necessarily the best option for the company/user
- decisions become subjective
- don't solve the right problem

# How do we research?
### Plan
  - What is the core purpose of this project?
  - Goals of company and goals of users lead to?
  - What is the core purpose of this design change?
       - Solve a problem
       - Sell something
       - Build guidelines or structure
       - Compete
       - Reflect or analyze

### Types of research
  - Qualitative: Ethnographic, interviews
  - Quantitative: Surveys, testing, Analytics
  - Internal or External (competitive audits)

### Different ways to conduct research
  - Background/history of company
  - Interviews with client and users
  - Competitive market analysis: An assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current and potential competitors. This analysis provides both an offensive and defensive strategic context to identify opportunities and threats.

  - SWOT analysis: A study undertaken by an organization to identify its internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as its external opportunities and threats.

# What do we do with the data?
- Wordlists
- Merge the unexpected
- Find patterns and similarities
- Iterate and prototype
- Synthesize the information in a creative brief or case study

## Explorer Mode

Project 1 is to design a native mobile app for a coffee retailer. You will be building on this project in stages through your daily and weekend homework assignments over the next two weeks.

You will keep all of the assets and information organized and store it inside a single repo on Github called **coffeeapp**. Tonight you will begin the project by doing some research on your coffee app.
 
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [Online Markdown Editor](http://dillinger.io/)

Your research should include:
- any notes from our Design Thinking challenge you deem relevant.
- determining the background information/history
- SWOT Analysis
- creating a wordlist
- features that you will include

## What to Submit

1. Save all of your research in a Markdown file called **research.md**. 
2. Using your research, write a synthesized creative brief using Markdown and save it in the **README.md** file of your Github repository. 

Link to your Github repository.

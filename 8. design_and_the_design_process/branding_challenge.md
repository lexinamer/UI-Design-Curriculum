## Branding Challenge
This exercise will help you start thinking about the functions of typography and color in relation to a brand or company. 

1. In Codepen, fork [this pen](http://codepen.io/lexinamer/pen/akLYAR) and rename it with `Branding Challenge- Your Name`. 
2. Using **only** CSS, style the page to match the company that you drew from the hat. 
3. We will go over them in class tomorrow and try to guess what your company is based only on the color scheme and type that you chose. 

### What to submit
Make sure to save your pen and paste the link below. 

> Notes: Pay attention to the details. Implement Google Fonts, colors ([here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) is a good list to get started, borders, font weight, capitalization, and font size to help you. Remember, you CANNOT touch the HTML.

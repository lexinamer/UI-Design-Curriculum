## Directory and Positioning Practice
This homework will help you get more comfortable with the command line, file and path structure, and layout and positioning using HTML and CSS. You must use [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and separate project folders for each of the steps 2-6. 

1. Set up 5 Project Folders via the command line and change the title in the `<head>` to reflect the folder titles
`hwproject1, hwproject2, hwproject3, hwproject4, hwproject5`

2. HW Project 1- Practice creating text elements, adding classes, and styling them through CSS.

3. HW Project 2- Build off HW Project 1 by adding text and classes, but now add `<div>`s around the certain elements of the text to start separating out different sections. Style the `<div>`s and practice margins, paddings, and borders.

4. HW Project 3- Learn page layout by practicing your `float` properties styling divs and text elements. Try creating a layout with 2 boxes, 3 boxes, and 4 boxes, and experiment with positioning by adjusting the margins and padding. Note: Your floats must equal exactly 100% (including margins).

5. HW Project 4- Work on centering different elements both horizontally and vertically, including single and multiple lines of text, and inline and block objects. Use the CSS Tricks guide in the "CSS Layouts" Lesson in TIYO. 

6. HW Project 5- Practice putting all of these together by creating a styled webpage about a topic of your choice. Work on nesting and understanding the parent/child relationship by creating `<div>`s within `<div>`s and text. Try adding links and images.

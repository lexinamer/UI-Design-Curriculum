## Explorer Mode

A big part of your process is going to be sketching website layouts to figure out the best possible interaction for your users. This is a very important _first_ step before you jump into design or code.  Sketching allows you to get all of your ideas on paper, and while you want to try to be neat, you don't have to be perfect (no rulers necessary!).  Make sure to include the grid columns, type of grid, and enough information so that a person with no context would understand the elements in your sketch. Also, make sure to include how many columns the grid has.

Here's an example of a good sketch. This is a because it has a lot of detail, lots of labeling, including the name or address of the website. Grid columns are noticeable.

This is a bad sketch because there is not a lot of detail, itâ€™s hard to see the grid throughout the whole image, not a lot of labeling of sections.

##### Notes

Use the following sites to create your sketches. Sketch both a desktop and a small screen size:
- [Mashable](http://mashable.com/)
- [Penguin](http://www.penguin.com/)
- [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/designers)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/) - no small size necessary

## What to Submit

* A link to a repository containing images of your sketches. (You can take pictures of them with your phone or computer)

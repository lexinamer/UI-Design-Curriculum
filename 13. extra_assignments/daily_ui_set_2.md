# Explorer Mode
The [Daily UI](http://dailyui.co) Challenge is a 20 week exercise that was developed by designers to "become a better designer in 100 days." Essentially, you sign up to receive an email prompt everyday and you have to design the UI for it. It went viral in the design community. 

While this exercise has its limitations because it doesn't give you any concept around the task and you literally just are creating a visual from scratch, it is a good exercise to get you fluent in the design tools we are using and to start thinking about UI. 

[Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/) is the "show and tell for designers" and a place where designers post their works. While much of the works looks the same [see: this article](https://blog.intercom.com/the-dribbblisation-of-design/) it is a good place for inspirations and to view beautiful work. 

### Assignment

Over the weekend, complete 2-3 Daily Uis and post them on [Behance](https://www.behance.net). You can sign up for the email list or you can find the prompt by going to Dribbble and searching for _DailyUI #_ (ex: DailyUI #001)


### Tips
- Try to give yourself some sort of time parameter (ex 1 hour to complete it) and push yourself to finish it within that time limit even if it isn't perfect.
- Come up with some kind of branding/theme/product that you are going to design for with each. This will make it easier to come up with your design. 
- Design for different devices and use the Illustrator sizes as a guide. For example, do the first one as a desktop design, the second one as mobile, etc.
- You might hate your designs but this is ok because you are learning the skills and it also shows you what you like and dislike within design.

## Explorer Mode

Over the weekend, you will develop the mobile version of the [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) website. The project is broken into four stages. The stages will take you through laying out the scaffolding for the page, filling in styles, text and finally images. You should use each stage as a guide and should work on this assignment over the next few days to avoid leaving it to the last minute.

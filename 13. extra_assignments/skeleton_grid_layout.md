> *Notes*
> - For the icons, feel free to use images that you find on Google. We will discuss icons and fonts tomorrow. 
> - You must use Normalize.css and sketch it out before you start to code.
> - For the images, you can just use lightgray boxes as a placeholder
> - Teal: #13a89e // Lighter Gray: #3a3a3a // Darker Gray: #333333
> - Follow the order to completion
>    - get the structure done first
>    - then add the text from top to bottom
>    - style the text and buttons last (hint: you will use the `<button></button>` tag to create the buttons and a standard `<ul></ul>` to create the menu at the top)

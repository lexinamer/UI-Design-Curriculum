## Project 3: Museum Website
Project 3 is a group project to create a responsive 3-5 page website. You will be broken into 3 teams which will be determined based part on choice and part on strengths and weaknesses.  

Tonight, each of you will write a proposal responding to the RFP (request for proposal) and next week, each group will collectively decide which project gets the "contract." It should look professional, be detailed, and be free from spelling errors. For submission, please follow the instructions on the RFP. You can view a sample proposal [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/at3rreuwzdog6ax/LexiNamer_ISSDesignProposal.pdf?dl=0).

[Click here to download the RFP](https://github.com/lexinamer/tiyraleigh/blob/master/assignments/museum/NcMuseumRFP.pdf)

## What to submit
Save your proposal to Google Drive or Dropbox and send me the link. Your proposal must be saved as a PDF titled "lastname_museumproposal" and should be NO MORE than 2 pages. 

In the comments, please put 3 classmates that you might like to be partnered with. This will remain anonymous.

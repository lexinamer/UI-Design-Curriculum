  Personas to prep for usability tests
---
Over the remainder of the week, you will be conducting usability tests on the site that your group selected. Your first step is to understand the organization and its users so that you can design an appropriate user test. 

Explore the chosen website and take notes on what the site does. 

Create 2 personas for possible users of that site. Export them as a single PDF file and host them somewhere online (Dropbox, Google Drive, Github, etc). Post the link to the submission URL.

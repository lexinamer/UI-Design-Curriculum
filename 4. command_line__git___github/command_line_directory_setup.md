## Explorer Mode

Using the command line, set up a directory which will serve as a template for all your HTML projects going forward. 

1. Create a main **directory** on your desktop called `projecttemplate`
2. Inside `projecttemplate`, create two **directories** for `images` and `css`
3. Create a **file** called `index.html`
4. Inside the `css` directory, create a **file** called style.css



Next, practice using the command line to set up a directory to organize your notes and assignments for the rest of the week. 

1. Create a directory on the desktop called `tiy`
2. Inside `tiy`, create a **directory** called `week-01`
3. Inside each of those directories, create **directories** for each day of the week called `day-01` `day-02` etc.
4. Inside each of those directories, put the following:
* an `examples` **directory** for you to put the code that you write in class that day
* an `assignments` **directory** for you to put the homework assignment(s) that are due that day
* a `README.md` **file** for you to put written notes for that day

Once you are complete, You should see the following path:

```
/Users/YOUR_PATH/tiy/week-01
├── day-01
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── assignments
│   └── examples
├── day-02
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── assignments
│   └── examples
├── day-03
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── assignments
│   └── examples
├── day-04
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── assignments
│   └── examples
└── day-05
    ├── README.md
    ├── assignments

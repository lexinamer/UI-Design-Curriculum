# Why Prototyping? 
A good user experience doesn’t get delivered just like that. It’s the result of the countless hours of efforts spent in the product development process, from conceptualization to the final delivery. It involves designing and redesigning your product or app based on a series of exhaustive user testing sessions, and let’s face it, you cannot perform a user testing session with static assets like wireframes or visual mockups. There has to be some sort of interactivity, otherwise your users won’t get a taste of how the product/app actually works.

This is where prototypes come in.

# What is a prototype?
It’s a simulation of the final product. It’s like an interactive mockup that can have any degree of fidelity. The main purpose of building prototypes is to test whether or not the flow of the product is smooth and consistent.

Prototypes breathe life into any design and provide a great deal of insight into the user interaction at various levels. Not only do prototypes allow us to test the feasibility and usability of our designs, they also lead to unexpected discoveries and innovations that may or may not take our project beyond its initial scope.

# Different levels of prototyping
![fidelity](https://mariagraziamerlo.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/prototype_fidelity.png?w=636) 

Fidelity refers to how closely a prototype resembles the final solution. There are multiple dimensions of fidelity, and prototypes can lie anywhere on the spectrum for each of these dimensions. Depending on the stage of the design process and the goals of the prototype, select the appropriate fidelity for each of the following:

- Visual fidelity (sketched ↔ styled)
- Functional fidelity (static ↔ interactive)
- Content fidelity (lorem ipsum ↔ real content)

# The prototyping spectrum
### Low Fidelity 
- Pencil and paper/ sketches
- Static
- Quick and low cost

### Medium Fidelity
- Software (Omnigraffle, Invision, Axure etc)
- Dynamic
- Stencils or wireframes
- More time intensive than low fidelity but still quick

### High Fidelity 
- Software (Omnigraffle, Invision, Axure etc)
- Can be done in code (markups)
- Dynamic
- Detailed visuals and functionality
- Time intensive

# What is Invision
InVision is a prototyping tool created for designers, by designers. It allows you to quickly and easily create interactive mockups for your designs. When you’re ready, you can share these mockups with your team or clients. It makes presenting your designs a breeze, and is much more effective than sending out a .PDF or screen shots. You can discuss the mockups right inside the app by leaving comments, that are connected to a point on the screen that you are discussing.

Also, it is super easy to use and free.

### Why Invision is Awesome
1. Beautiful presentation
2. Extreme control of design that mimics the web environment
3. Can add comments and notes directly on the prototypes
4. Mobile prototyping with gestures
5. Version history for rapid iteration
6. Hover states!
7. Life share- new features that allows real time collaboration

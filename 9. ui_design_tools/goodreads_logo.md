  Practice your illustrator skills by iterating your logo
---
## Explorer Mode
Create 15 versions of your Goodreads logo in Illustrator. Place each logo in a grid and work quickly. Each logo needs to varied, this only needs to be a slight variation. For example, you can create a logo that you like and then tweak the color, layout, etc for another variation. This should be created in **ONE** Illustrator document.

Here is a post from a former TIY student who did this challenge: http://jessecrow.com/projects/goodreads.html

## What to Submit
Export your logos as LastName_GoodreadsLogo as a PDF. Add them to Google Drive or a Github repo or somewhere online and share the link.

## Adventure Mode
For more practice, give yourself another logo challenge. Spend 15 minutes doing rapid brainstorming and iteration and then pull the top 3 ideas into Illustrator to create the logo.

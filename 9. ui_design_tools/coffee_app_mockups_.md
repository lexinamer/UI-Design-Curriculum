  Coffee App Mockups 
description: >-
  Using what you learned in class, create mockups for your coffee app
---
# Explorer Mode
Using Sketch, your wireframes, and the color and type scheme you selected, create mockups for your coffee app. The mockups should include each of your screens. All layers should be organized and labeled, and ready for a developer. Github supports Sketch files but if they are super large files, they may not upload. Try to upload the Sketch file of your mockups to your Github Repo and if it is too large, upload it to Google Drive instead.

This assignment will take place over the next two days so make sure to work on it a bit at a time.   

# What to Submit
- A link to your Github repo.

# Explorer Mode
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) is a free website for book lovers. Imagine it as a large library that you can wander through and see everyone's bookshelves, their reviews, and their ratings. You can also post your own reviews and catalog what you have read, are currently reading, and plan to read in the future.

Project 2 is going to be a redesign of the Goodreads web app for the user bookshelf or "my books" section of the website. Keep in mind that you will be prototyping this project in code and it needs to be responsive. Here is the current version of the dashboard:

Here is an example of robust research by a former TIY student: https://github.com/crowjm/tiy_assignments/blob/master/day_39/goodreads-research.md

### Requirements 
- Do some background research on the company, mission and users. Write up your findings in a creative brief. If you don't already use Goodreads, feel free to open an account and play around with it.
- Pay attention to the purpose of the bookshelf as well as the pros and cons (both functionality and aesthetically)

### What to Submit
A link to a Github repo named "goodreadsbookshelf" with your research and creative brief in the README.md file

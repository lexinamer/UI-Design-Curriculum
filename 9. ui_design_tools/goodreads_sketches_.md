## Explorer Mode

On paper, sketch out a version for your Goodreads bookshelf. Each sketch should include desktop, mobile and tablet versions. 

Pay attention to the current Goodreads site and keep in mind what your target purpose and user is while you are making the sketches. Even across the different screen sizes, they should feel cohesive. Make sure to write a label or title on each.

  Coffee App Prototypes

  Create a clickable prototype for your coffee app
---
# Explorer Mode
Using your Mockups and Invision, create a clickable prototype for your coffee app. This should include any supplemental screens you may need to be a fully comprehensive prototype. As the user, I should be able to click through your app and understand the functionality and behavior. 

# Adventure Mode
Using additional screens that you create, try to make a more thorough and comprehensive prototype. This may include a launch page, hamburger menu, additional screens (for form fill in), camera functionality for check deposits, etc. 

# What to Submit
In Invision, once you are finished with your prototype, click on the "share" button to get the link. Copy that link and put it in the URL section. 

In the comments section, rate how you feel about this project.

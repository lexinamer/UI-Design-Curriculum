# What is Photoshop? 
Even if you've never worked with images on your computer, you may have heard of Photoshop. Available for both Windows and Mac, Adobe Photoshop is an extremely powerful application that's used by many professional photographers and designers. You can use Photoshop for almost any kind of image editing, such as touching up photos, creating high-quality graphics, and creating mockups and layouts for the web.

Photoshop provides many image editing features for raster (pixel-based) images as well as vector graphics. It uses a layer-based editing system that enables image creation and altering with multiple overlays that support transparency.

# Why Use Photoshop for Design Elements
Photoshop is a one-stop-shop, letting a designer create or adjust anything relatively quickly, without breaking their concentration to work in another application. 

It is by far the most widely used product in the web design industry. Clients may want or expect that you use this product and similarly, third parties that deliver to you may deliver their finished products to you in .psd format. 

The images used on the web (jpg, png, gif) are bitmapped rather than vector graphics. Using Photoshop makes it easy to export images in the right format and sizes and to apply lighting effects, shadows, etc.

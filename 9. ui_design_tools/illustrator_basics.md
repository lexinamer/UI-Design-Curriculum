# What is Illustrator? 
Illustrator is a vector drawing program. It is often used to draw illustrations, cartoons, diagrams, charts and logos. Unlike bitmap images that stores information in a grid of dots, Illustrator uses mathematical equations to draw out the shapes. This makes vector graphics scalable without the loss of resolution.

# Bitmap v Vector Graphics
In general, any image that you take from a digital source is automatically saved as a bitmap file. So when you take a photograph using a digital camera, or scan an image from a paper source, you are creating a bitmap image. These bitmap images are made-up of a matrix of individual dots, also known as pixels, which all have their own color.

Vector graphics are created in graphics packages. They consist of shapes called objects, and each object can be editing separately, by changing the shape, size, position and adding color. They are created with lines, all joined together with a collection of points. The most common way to draw vector graphics within these design programs is using Bezier curves, as they tend to be the easiest and quickest way to get the perfect design.

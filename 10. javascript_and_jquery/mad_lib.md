# Explorer Mode

Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.


### Example Output

```
Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: walk
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quickly
Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
```

### Constraints
1. Use a single output statement for this program.

### Notes

> One tool that will help you with this challenge is the `prompt` command to collect input and display output. Additionally you will want to use variables to store the input and string concatenation (the `+` symbol) to create the final output statement. 

### What to Submit
* A link to your CodePen

## Adventurer Mode
Add more inputs to the program to expand the story.

Solve the following problems in Codepen using what you learned in class:

## Fizzbuzz
One of the most popular coding assignments in a tech screen. Hint, you can use an if statement inside a loop. 

Loop through 1 - 100 printing out each number based on the following rules:
- If the number is divisible by both, log FizzBuzz
- If the number is divisible by 3, log Fizz
- If the number is divisible by 5, log Buzz
- If none of the previous rules apply, just log the number 


## Weather Station
Write an if statement that returns the following for the months of the year: 
- If Dec, Jan, Feb, log "Wear a coat" 
- If Mar, Apr, May, log "Wear a tshirt"
- If Jun, Jul, Aug, log "Wear shorts" 
- If Sep, Oct, Nov, log "Wear a jacket"


## Longest Words
Write a function that accepts an array of strings and the longest word is returned.

```js
var words = ['Today', 'February', 'Winter', 'Ask'];
function findLongestWord(words);
//--> Returns February
```

## Total Numbers
Write a function that accepts an array of numbers and returns their total.

```js
const numbers = [10, 20, -5, 3.5];
function getSum(numbers);
//--> Returns 28.5
```

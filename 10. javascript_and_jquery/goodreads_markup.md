  Using what you learned in class, create mockups for the Goodreads bookshelf redesign.
---
## Explorer Mode
Using your mockups, create a prototype in code using HTML and CSS. This should be essentially a completed version of your Goodreads homepage and should include any text, typography, colors, and images. Don't forget hover states, and your webpage should be responsive using media queries. 

## Notes
- Make sure to organize your code- I will be looking through it when reviewing your projects and if the code is unreadable, it will be an incomplete 
- You must use Normalize.css
- You must use Sass with at least 4 variables and 3 partials
- You must use media queries (remember they need to be at the bottom of your stylesheet)
- Tip: refactor your code when you are finished by running it through a validator and cleaning it up

## What to Submit
- Push your project files to the root of your Github repo and submit the Github link in the URL
- Host your project on gh-pages and include the link in the comments
- Also in the comments, rate from 1-5 how you feel about this project. Write any comments you wish you tell me.

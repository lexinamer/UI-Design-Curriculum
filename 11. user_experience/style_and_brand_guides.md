  The importance of creating style and brand guides
---
# What is a style guide? 
Style guides contain all the necessary information to create visuals for a company. It is often a document, which can range from a couple of pages, to several hundred, is the thread that holds together what the public sees from a company. They may be known as brand bibles, style guides, branding guides, or identity manuals. 

Its a big way to ensure that a team is on the same page when designing separate parts of the website. It helps create a cohesive experience among different pages, and ensure that future development or third-party production will follow brand guidelines and will be perceived as part of the overall brand.


# Creating a Style Guide
Style guides are a collection of pre-designed elements, graphics and rules designers or developers should follow to ensure that separate website pieces will be consistent and will create a cohesive experience at the end.


### Understand the Brand 
First, you need to study the brand so that you understand what it stands for. Get to know the story behind the brand, observe the team and figure out the vision, mission and values of the company. It is important to dig deeper into the brand so the style guide you produce will visually and emotionally represent the organization.


### Logo Usage
Once you have the perfect logo, it is important to maintain the integrity of it across platforms. This includes how the logo is to be used, from placement to acceptable alterations. Show how a logo should look in different formats (square, rectangle, round) and on both light and dark values. 


### Fonts and Typography
You must get typography right because it is one of the most important communication tools between visitors and your website.

Set hierarchy and identify it. There are headline types: h1,h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6. Then body copy, bold and italic variations. Think about custom copy that will be used for smaller links, intro text and so on. Provide font family, weight and color.


### Colors
Begin by setting primary colors for your style guide that will dominate your website, dominant colors should include no more than three shades. In some cases, however, you will need secondary and even tertiary colors to illustrate your user interface, make sure you define them too. Also include neutral colors like white, grey and black for the primary brand colors to stand out.

Make sure you include the hex codes and what they should each be used for. 


### Voice
The voice that I am referring to is actual copy. You have studied the brand before starting the style guide and found out that brand is youthful and trendy. If there are no directions for voice of the copy, you have to define it. It can be a simple example given showing that voice has to be professional yet funny and welcoming. 

Instead of stating “You’ve got 404 error” you can say “Oh boy, you’ve broken the interwebs. 404 error.” If the voice were more corporate, you wouldn’t do that. Remember microcopy


### Iconography
Define a set or guide of icons that you will use. This could be choosing an icon library like font awesome or something more specified. Think about the brand and its values so you don’t use hand-drawn icons on a large banking website.


### Imagery
Guidelines for images are about more than just whether you will rely on photography or illustrations or other types of graphics. The style guide should detail how images will be gathered, edited and used.

Nike, for example, relies on large, tight, high-contrast images to draw you in. The I Love NY campaign above uses location-based images from photos that are restyled as drawings to capture attention and create a feel.

Image guidelines should also define when and how certain types of images are used. Will you use photography or illustrations or both? Is clip art use acceptable? How will images be edited? Will they be black and white or color? All of these questions should be answered in your image guidelines.


### Links, Forms and Buttons
Give examples of links, forms and buttons, including any pseudo states such as hover and focus. This should include font size, color, border and radius, etc. 


### Spacing
It is extremely important to mention the spacing. It can be in the form of a grid used for a layout; it can be spacing defined between headlines, buttons, images, forms and other elements.

Make sure to mention any container, header and footer sizes, margins, and padding.

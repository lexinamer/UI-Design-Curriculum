# What is UX? 
UX, or User Experience, is the internal experience that a person has as they interact with every aspect of a company’s products and services. 

UI, or User Interface, is the series of screens, pages, and visual elements—like buttons and icons—that you use to interact with a device.

# Why learn UX?
It used to be that we made decisions based on what we thought the client wanted and what we thought looked good. There was no data backing up the decisions. Now we are moving more into user-centered design where the users dictate what happens. 

Although many people think usability and UX are the same, they aren't: UX addresses how a user feels when using a system, while usability is about the user-friendliness and efficiency of the interface.


# What does a UX Designer do?

## Research
Subjective Research
  - “What is your favorite color?”
  - “Do you trust this company?”
  - “Do I look nerdy in these glasses”?
        
Objective Research
  - “How long did you spend using our app?”
  - “Where did you find the link to our site?”
  - “How many people visited our website today?”


## Wireframes
Wireframes are developed to prototype distribution of existing site content for testing and iteration before the graphic interface and code are developed.


## Personas
A persona is a way to model, summarize and communicate research about people who have been observed or researched in some way. A persona is depicted as a specific person but is not a real individual; rather, it is synthesized from observations of many people. 

They describe the goals, expectations, motivations, and behavior of real people. Why do they come to your site? What are they looking for? What makes them nervous?

## User Stories
A User Story describes one possible path a user can take on your site or app. It should be short, but complete. You will need many user stories to describe your whole design.

> A basic user story for Google.com might look like this:
> - The user arrives on the main search page.
> - The user can enter any search query and submit with the mouse or keyboard.
> - The next page displays a list of search results with the most relevant results on top.
> - The user can click the link to go to the appropriate site, or they can navigate through more pages of results until they find something useful.

**Note:** This is a little too simple, but you get the idea.

Notice that nothing in the story tells me specifically how to solve or design those actions; just that they are possible. The purpose of these stories is to describe flows. Sequences of user choices. Not the final UI.

## User Scenarios and Storyboards
A user scenario expands upon your user stories by including details about how a system might be interpreted, experienced, and used.

A scenario is a narrative describing “a day in the life of” one of your personas, including how your website or app fits into their lives. If you’re familiar with writing user stories in an agile environment, you’ll be comfortable writing scenarios—although the focus here is on regular usage, not edge cases.

Depending on the audience, a storyboard may be a more appropriate tool for capturing how, when, where and why someone might use your product.

## User Flow
A form of visual documentation that illustrates how users encounter your website’s content, as well as the sequence of their interactions once they get there. This is where your stories, scenarios and cases can be mapped out in a way that applies more directly to information architecture and user interface design decisions.

## User Testing
- Hypothesize
- Design
  * What are you testing? 
  * What are the answers you are trying to solve?
  * What are the customer segments you need to test on?

- Types of User Testing
  * Interviews: 3 Basic Types of questions:
       * Open - “How would you describe me?” 
       * Leading - "What are my nerdiest features"?
       * Closed/Direct - "What is prettier my hair or my eyes"?

  * User Tests: Give users tasks and figure out where they get stuck (what can you optimize?)

  * A/B Testing: Create different versions of a test, serve them up to different user segments to see how they react

- Analyze and report data

  Redesign of non profit site
---
# Non Profit Group Project
For your first group project, you are going to be rebranding and designing (or redesigning) a responsive website for a local non profit. Each team member should be responsible for at least 2 pages (or features) of the site. 

We will be using the design process, a branding guide, github collaboration, and gh-pages to host the final version. The following dates are suggested to keep you on track and able to complete this project in time. We will present these next Weds, April 5. 

# Project Timeline

## Creative Brief (complete 3/29)
In class, your team will be tasked with deciding on a non profit and doing a simple design thinking challenge similar to what we did with Spotify and Evernote. During this time, figure out the company's mission, target audience, SWOT, competitor analysis, and important features. 

Write this up in a README.md file using markdown as a creative brief and push it to your project's main Github repo. 


## Sketches (complete 3/29)
Using pen and paper, sketch out what your multi-page site will look like. Focus on the key features that you want to work on, with each team member tackling at least 2 pages. Make sure to sketch out how it will look on medium and small devices. 

This would also be a good time to make a content inventory or list of all the content, features, images, etc that you will need to complete this project. 


## Style Guide (complete 3/30)
Come up with a robust style guide that you will use when coding your project. This might include colors, fonts, typography, buttons, etc. I don't care how you want to write this up- Sketch, Codepen, Pages, etc. 


## Mockups (complete 4/1)
Using the program of your team's choice, collaboratively create mockups for your site. The more detailed the mockups and style guide, the more successful your project will be when it comes time to code independently and still stay consistent. 


## Markups (complete 4/4)
Now, you will code your projects, making sure to stay on brand and consistent throughout your pages. You probably want to have a single repo on Github where you each are collaborators. Even though you will be working on your own features and pages, you want to talk with your team members throughout the week/end to check on progress. 

Make sure to commit often and pull from the master branch before you push. 


## Refine and Debug (complete 4/5)
Make sure to leave time to debug any merge conflicts, styling or responsiveness issues, and prepare for your presentations.

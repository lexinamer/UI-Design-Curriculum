### CSS Frameworks
- In the world of web design,  a framework is defined as a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) which can be used to support the development of websites, as a basis to start building a site.

- The aim of frameworks is to provide a common structure so that developers donâ€™t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the code provided. 

- Front end frameworks usually consist of a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.)

- Two Types 
  - Simple: 960 Grid, Susy, Base, Toast
  - Complex: Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton

### The Way it Works
Container 
```html
<body>
   <div class="container">
   ---more content---
</body>
```

Rows 
```html
<div class="container">
   <div class="row">
   </div>
</div>
```

```html
<div class="container">
   <div class="row">
      <div class="olumn-info">content</div>
      <div class="olumn-inf">content</div>
   </div>
</div>
```

## Explorer Mode
Over the weekend, you will undergo this assignment that I like to call CSS Bootcamp. Using HTML and CSS, you will recreate the [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/) homepage. Your goal for this assignment is to get this looking and behaving as closely to the real site as possible. 

It must be responsive, and you must use Sass. You can use Skeleton but you will probably also need media queries for the smaller elements. 

#### Notes: 
- Since we haven't learned CSS animations yet, you do not need to do the blinking cursor (though bonus points if you can figure it out- hint [Codepen](codepen.io) is an awesome resource). 
- TIY uses a Pro front from Adobe but the Google Font [PT Serif](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Serif) is similar.   
- The Inspector tool in Chrome will be your best friend! `OPT` `CMD` `I` 
- Push to Github often. Your project getting erased/corrupted will not work as an excuse for not turning the assignment in. 
- To get the assets, use the inspector tool or drag icons and logos to your computer. 
- If something breaks, run your code through an [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) or [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validator. 


#### What to Submit:
- Github Repo called _tiy-homework-cssbootcamp_
- There must be at least three commits (one per day you are working) though ideally more.

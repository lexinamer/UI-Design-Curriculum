  Introduction to resposnive design and grid systems on the Web

## Types of design 
Responsive Web Design (RWD) is the current approach to web design aimed at allowing desktop webpages to be viewed in response to the size of the device one is viewing with.

#### Two Types
- Adaptive Design: Static for each screen size (different index.html)
- Responsive Design: Flexible images and grid (same index.html)[Adaptive v Responsive Infographic](http://soshable.com/understanding-differences-adaptive-responsive-website-design/adaptive-vs-responsive-infographic/)

## Introduction to Grids
Designers solve problems. Web designers are faced with finding solutions to visual and organizational problems and one approach to solving these problems is the grid. It uses rows and columns to order and structure information and content. 

#### Why use grids? 
- Clarity/Order — Grids bring order to a layout making it easier for visitors to find and navigate through information.
- Efficiency — Grids allow designers to quickly add elements to a layout because many layout decisions are addressed while building the grid structure.
- Economy — Grids make it easier for other designers to work and collaborate on the design as they provide a plan for where to place elements.
- Consistency/Harmony — Grids lead to consistency in the layout of pages across a single site or even several sites creating a structural harmony in the design.

## Common Considerations
- Pay attention to rows, columns, gutters and containers

- Sizing grids: Typically use percentages for containers

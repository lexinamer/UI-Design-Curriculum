## Explorer Mode
Over the course of this assignment, you will create an environmental website for the NC Conservation Network. Your website should look exactly like this [demo](https://lexinamer.github.io/envndemo/). 


1. You must use at least 2 partials
2. Use Font Awesome for the icons.
3. Get the nav functioning as it does in the demo, and pay attention to hover and dropdown states.
4. For layout, try to use flexbox and percentages as much as possible and only declare a specific height when necessary (such as the header).
5. You must use at least 2 variables and 1 mixin. 
6. You must use media queries to make the site responsive. Hint: this would be a great place to use a partial.

**Notes: Each of your Sass (SCSS) files must be organized, clearly readable, and each under 80 lines of code. Remember, when in doubt, you are probably overthinking it and trying to make it too complex**


### What to Submit
- Add the link to your Github repo in the URL section of the submission. 
- In the comments section, include a link to the live hosted version using gh-pages.

Keep in mind that I will be heavily reviewing your code, so if it doesn't meet the above criteria, it will be marked as incomplete and you will have to redo it.

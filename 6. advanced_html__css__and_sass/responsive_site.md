## Explorer Mode

Using the breakpoint images below, create the the website using HTML and CSS. For each breakpoint, starting with the first, you will do the following:

1. Create a repo on Github called _tiy-homework-responsivesite_
2. Sketch out how the layout for that breakpoint will look in your notebook. 
1. Add, commit and push your pictures.
1. Write the HTML and CSS for your layout in an `index.html` file and `css/style.css` file.
1. Add, commit and push your code.

###### Breakpoints

1. [Breakpoint 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lexinamer/tiyraleigh/master/assignments/responsivesite/breakpoint1.png) - 0 to 478px
2. [Breakpoint 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lexinamer/tiyraleigh/master/assignments/responsivesite/breakpoint2.png) - 479px to 767px
3. [Breakpoint 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lexinamer/tiyraleigh/master/assignments/responsivesite/breakpoint3.png) - 768px to 978px
4. [Breakpoint 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lexinamer/tiyraleigh/master/assignments/responsivesite/breakpoint4.png) - 979px and larger

##### Notes

> - For the first three breakpoints, the content (pricing boxes and paragraphs) should stretch to fit the width of the page as it scales. For the fourth breakpoint, the content should max out at 960px and not grow larger than that. Instead it should stay centered on the page.
> 
> - I recommend that you glance over all of the breakpoints before you write any code to get a feel for how the different elements move around. Structure your HTML in a way that will make it easy to make these adjustments **only using css**. We can't modify our HTML based on page width, only our CSS, so your HTML needs to remain consistent no-matter what the width of the page is.
>
> - You may not need to use media queries for all of the breakpoints.
>
> - The changes between breakpoints may be subtle. Subtlety is a key tenet in UI design so make sure you take a good look at the images both scaled and minimized to get an understanding on the differences. 
>
> - For the header image, find an image from Unsplash.com. Use the following hex colors:
Green: #519251 
Blue: #2c4985

##### What to Submit

A link to your repo containing at least:

* `index.html`
* `images/background.jpg`
* `css/style.css`

Link: Github Repo
Notes: Github Pages Link

## Adventure Mode

Using the breakpoint images below, create the the website using HTML and CSS. Try to re-use as much CSS as you can from the normal mode to make your life easier.

## Explorer Mode
Over the course of this assignment, you will use HTML and CSS to create an engaging about page that describes who you are, where you come from, and what your future goals are. 

**Stage 1:** Review the inspiration guide below and find a style that you will try to emulate for your about page. Gather all of your content and images and set up your directory using the ProjectTemplate you created in the first part of today's homework.

**Stage 2:** Using only HTML, begin to code your about page. Don't worry how it looks but focus on writing clean, easy to read code. This should include all content and links. 

**Stage 3:** Complete your page using CSS and any additional content needed. The styling should be consistent across all elements of the page and cohesive. 

### Notes: 
- You must include at least 2 images, 2 external links (can be to social media accounts), a menu (with dropdown), and use an external style sheet.

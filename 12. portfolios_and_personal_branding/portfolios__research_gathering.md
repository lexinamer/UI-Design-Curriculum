# 1. Find Inspiration
Tonight, find 3 portfolio examples that inspire you and you think are successful. Keep in mind that they should be clear, straightforward, and show good process. 

Choose your favorite one an put that link in the assignment submission form. Be ready to show us the site in class tomorrow and defend your decision of why you choose it. Try to start talking about process and using design specific terms. Really get into the "why" instead of the "I like."


# 2. Content Organization
Select at least 2 projects we have completed in this course that will be in your portfolio. This can include the hackathon, Goodreads, non-profit, or coffee app. List those in the notes section. 


# 3.New Project
You will be working on some kind of personal project over the next two weeks. In the notes section, include at least 1 idea for that. This could be something your passionate about, a redesign, a UX project, a series of daily designs or codes, something you've wanted to learn or get better at. 

Flush this idea out as much as possible to you can start working immediately.  


# 4. Tagline
Based on what we have learned so far in this course, come up with a tagline for yourself. Think about your skills and strengths and what you wish to do after this course. List that in the notes section.

The readings below will help you on this quest and just remember, the title is less important than being able to articulately explain what you are passionate about and want to do. This will probably change over time but the most important thing is to identify if you are drawn to design, coding, or both.

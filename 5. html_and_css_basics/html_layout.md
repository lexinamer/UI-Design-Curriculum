## Explorer Mode

Using your knowledge of HTML and CSS, replicate the displayed in [this PDF file](https://github.com/lexinamer/tiyraleigh/blob/master/assignments/html-layout1/redboxes.pdf) in a file called `index.html`. You should omit the pixel size text in each element. That is just there as a reference for you. Notice that there are not width dimensions on some of the boxes. Your page should consume the **full width of the page** no matter how large the browser window is. As the browser window size grows or shrinks so should the horizontal dimensions of the boxes. For places where there are horizontal space measurements they should remain that fixed size.

Put all of your css for both pages in a `style.css` file within a styles directory.

Your home page (`index.html`) and your second page (`blueboxes.html`) should have links to each other (see the navigation at the top of the pages).

## What to Submit

This assignment directory should be named **lastname_htmllayout1 (ex: namer_htmllayout1).** Please compress this and upload the zipped folder to Dropbox.com or Google Drive. It should include the following files. Put the link in the assignment submission.

* `index.html`
* `css/style.css`

## Adventurer Mode

*Adventurer mode is optional if you have extra time and want to challenge yourself*.

Next, replicate the layout displayed in [this image file](https://github.com/lexinamer/tiyraleigh/blob/master/assignments/html-layout1/blueboxes.pdf) in a file called `blueboxes.html`.

You'll notice that there are no dimensions for these boxes- you should enter the Lorem Ipsum content and the boxes should conform to whatever size the content dictates. **Note: It may not look exactly like the image in the picture because of different browsers and screen sizes**

Trim down your total HTML to 1650 characters or fewer **while maintaining proper indentation and understandable class names**. It's no good if your markup is unreadable.

Trim down your total CSS to 2000 characters or fewer **while maintaining proper indentation and understandable class names**. It's no good if your CSS is unreadable. Don't count CSS normalization code if you are using something like normalize.css.

*The goal here is to make your code as efficient as possible. Cut out all the unnecessary markup and styling*.

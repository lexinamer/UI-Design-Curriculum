# HTML5 Semantics
Semantics have been a part of html in some form or another. It helps you understand what's happening where on the page.

Earlier when `<div>` was used for pretty much everything, we still implemented semantics by giving it a "semantic" class name or an id name.

HTML5 Semantics are tags that help with proper structuring and understanding of the layout.

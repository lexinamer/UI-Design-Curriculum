  CSS Positioning Codepens
description: >-
  Use CSS positioning to create the following layouts.
---
## Explorer Mode
1. Create a new Codepen
- Make a div with a class of "container" that will contain all of your future divs.
- Give the container div a:
    + Width of 90% at any screen size, but is 960px at maximum size
    + Padding of 20px
    + Background color of #cccccc
- Center the container div horizontally
- Add 2 new divs inside of the container div; one with a class of "left-col" and one with a class of "right-col"
- Both divs should have a width of 50% and a height of 200px
- "left-col" should be floated left and have a background of #2B7F7B
- "right-col" should be floated right and have a background of #07CCC1
- "container" should wrap entirely around both "right-col" and "left-col"
- Save the pen and copy the link somewhere.

2.  Start a new pen by forking the one you just created
- After forking, add a new div with a class of "main" that has the same height as "left-col" and "right-col"
- Give "main" a background of #993654
- "main" should appear below "left-col" and "right-col" and span the width of "container"
- below "main" add 3 divs with the class of "thirds" with a height of 200px
- "thirds" should have a background of #332546, floated left, with a 2% margin on the center div

-  For the following exercises, use these hexcodes:

- Grey: #cccccc
- Blue: #258aa5
- Purple: #e50e56
- Pink: #554466

3.  Create the following layout using relative positioning:

4.  Create the following layout using absolute positioning:

5.  Create the following layout using fixed positioning (the pink box should remain in view while scrolling):

**Note: This codepen doesn't have to look exactly as the image (the distance between the pink and grey box may vary depending on your browser width)**

##### What to Submit

Submit a link to each of the 4 CodePens you create.

## Adventurer Mode

*Adventurer mode is optional if you have extra time and want to challenge yourself*.

- Create your CodePen in steps 1 & 2 with 45 or less lines of well-formed CSS and no additional classes except for the ones defined in the instructions
- Create the first and second layout images with margin instead of positioning
